# Password Generator
> A password generator has been created for employees with access to sensitive data.  It will randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so a strong password can be created in order to ensure greater security.
> Live demo [_here_](https://kristinehkim.github.io/password-generator/). <!-- If you have the project hosted somewhere, include the link here. -->

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What problem does it (intend to) solve?
- What is the purpose of your project?
- Why did you undertake it?
The user will first choose the length of their password between 8 and 128 characters.  If the length is not within these limits, the user will be reminded to choose an appropriate length.  Then, the user will be presented with a series of prompts confirming whether or not they would like special characters, numbers, lowercase, and uppercase letters.  If none of these are chosen, the user will be reminded to choose at least one character.  Based on the characters the user chooses, one of each will be represented and a password will be generated.  This will create a secure password.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

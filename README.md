# Password Generator
> A password generator has been created for employees with access to sensitive data.  It will randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so a strong password can be created in order to ensure greater security.

## General Information
The user will first choose the length of their password between 8 and 128 characters.  If the length is not within these limits, the user will be reminded to choose an appropriate length.  Then, the user will be presented with a series of prompts confirming whether or not they would like special characters, numbers, lowercase, and/or uppercase letters.  If none of these are chosen, the user will be reminded to choose at least one character.  Based on the characters the user chooses, one of each will be represented and a password will be generated.  This will create a secure password.
